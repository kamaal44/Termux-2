gTTS (gtts.gTTS)¶ 
 
 class gtts.tts.gTTS(text, tld='com', lang='en', slow=False, lang_check=True, pre_processor_funcs=[<function tone_marks>, <function end_of_line>, <function abbreviations>, <function word_sub>], tokenizer_func=<bound method Tokenizer.run of re.compile('(?<=\\?).|(?<=!).|(?<=？).|(?<=！).|(?<!\\.[a-z])\\. |(?<!\\.[a-z]), |(?<!\\d):|：|،|…|\\[|‥|\\(|¿|\\)|;|、|\\]|—|\\\n|，|¡|。', re.IGNORECASE) from: [<function tone_marks>, <function period_comma>, <function colon>, <function other_punctuation>]>)[source]¶ 
gTTS – Google Text-to-Speech. 
An interface to Google Translate’s Text-to-Speech API. 
 
Parameters 
 
text (string) – The text to be read. 
tld (string) – Top-level domain for the Google Translate host, i.e https://translate.google.<tld>. This is useful when google.com might be blocked within a network but a local or different Google host (e.g. google.cn) is not. Default is com. 
lang (string, optional) – The language (IETF language tag) to read the text in. Default is en. 
slow (bool, optional) – Reads text more slowly. Defaults to False. 
lang_check (bool, optional) – Strictly enforce an existing lang, to catch a language error early. If set to True, a ValueError is raised if lang doesn’t exist. Setting lang_check to False skips Web requests (to validate language) and therefore speeds up instanciation. Default is True. 
pre_processor_funcs (list) – 
A list of zero or more functions that are called to transform (pre-process) text before tokenizing. Those functions must take a string and return a string. Defaults to: 
[ pre_processors.tone_marks, pre_processors.end_of_line, pre_processors.abbreviations, pre_processors.word_sub ]    
tokenizer_func (callable) – 
A function that takes in a string and returns a list of string (tokens). Defaults to: 
Tokenizer([ tokenizer_cases.tone_marks, tokenizer_cases.period_comma, tokenizer_cases.colon, tokenizer_cases.other_punctuation ]).run        
 
Raises 
 
AssertionError – When text is None or empty; when there’s nothing left to speak after pre-precessing, tokenizing and cleaning. 
ValueError – When lang_check is True and lang is not supported. 
RuntimeError – When lang_check is True but there’s an error loading the languages dictionary.    
 
 get_urls()[source]¶ 
Get TTS API request URL(s) that would be sent to the TTS API. 
 
Returns 
A list of TTS API request URLs to make.  
This is particularly useful to get the list of URLs generated by gTTS but not yet fullfilled, for example to be used by an external program.   
Return type 
list    
 
 save(savefile)[source]¶ 
Do the TTS API request and write result to file. 
 
Parameters 
savefile (string) – The path and file name to save the mp3 to.  
Raises 
gTTSError – When there’s an error with the API request.    
 
 write_to_fp(fp)[source]¶ 
Do the TTS API request(s) and write bytes to a file-like object. 
 
Parameters 
fp (file object) – Any file-like object to write the mp3 to.  
Raises 
 
gTTSError – When there’s an error with the API request. 
TypeError – When fp is not a file-like object that takes bytes.      
 
 exception gtts.tts.gTTSError(msg=None, **kwargs)[source]¶ 
Exception that uses context to present a meaningful error message 
 
 infer_msg(tts, rsp=None)[source]¶ 
Attempt to guess what went wrong by using known information (e.g. http response) and observed behaviour    
 
Languages (gtts.lang)¶ 
 
Note 
The easiest way to get a list of available languages is to print them with gtts-cli --all  
 
 gtts.lang.tts_langs(tld='com')[source]¶ 
Languages Google Text-to-Speech supports. 
 
Parameters 
tld (string) – Top-level domain for the Google Translate host to fetch languages from. i.e https://translate.google.<tld>. Default is com.  
Returns 
A dictionary of the type { ‘<lang>’: ‘<name>’}  
Where <lang> is an IETF language tag such as en or pt-br, and <name> is the full English name of the language, such as English or Portuguese (Brazil).   
Return type 
dict   
The dictionary returned combines languages from two origins: 
 
Languages fetched automatically from Google Translate 
Languages that are undocumented variations that were observed to work and present different dialects or accents.    
 
Examples¶ 
Write ‘hello’ in English to hello.mp3: 
>>> from gtts import gTTS >>> tts = gTTS('hello', lang='en') >>> tts.save('hello.mp3')   
Write ‘hello bonjour’ in English then French to hello_bonjour.mp3: 
>>> from gtts import gTTS >>> tts_en = gTTS('hello', lang='en') >>> tts_fr = gTTS('bonjour', lang='fr') >>> >>> with open('hello_bonjour.mp3', 'wb') as f: ...  tts_en.write_to_fp(f) ...  tts_fr.write_to_fp(f)   
Instead of writing to disk, get URL for ‘hello’ in English: 
>>> from gtts import gTTS >>> tts = gTTS('hello', lang='en') >>> tts.get_urls() ['https://translate.google.com/translate_tts?ie=UTF-8&q=hello&tl=en&ttsspeed=1&total=1&idx=0&client=tw-ob&textlen=5&tk=316070.156329']    
 
Playing sound directly¶ 
There’s quite a few libraries that do this. Write ‘hello’ to a file-like object to do further manipulation:: 
>>> from gtts import gTTS >>> from io import BytesIO >>> >>> mp3_fp = BytesIO() >>> tts = gTTS('hello', lang='en') >>> tts.write_to_fp(mp3_fp) >>> >>> # Load `mp3_fp` as an mp3 file in >>> # the audio library of your choice   
 
Note 
See Issue #26 for a discussion and examples of direct playback using various methods.  
 
Note 
Starting with gTTS 2.1.0, the gtts.tts.gTTS.get_urls method can be used to obtain the list of generated URLs requests (whithout fullfilling them) which could be used for playback in another program. See Examples above.   
 
Logging¶ 
gtts does logging using the standard Python logging module. The following loggers are available: 
 
gtts.tts
Logger used for the gTTS class  
gtts.lang
Logger used for the lang module (language fetching)  
gtts
Upstream logger for all of the above
